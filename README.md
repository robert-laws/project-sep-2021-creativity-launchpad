# Project - September 2021 - Creativity Launchpad

## Introduction

Students at my organization occasionally have assignments or projects that require working with media production tools and software. To work on these types of assignments, students come to the library to make use of the different hardware, software, and learning resources available to them. The process of discovering and choosing from the many resources available can be overwhelming at first. This is where the library can jump in and provide a tool that will help students discover recommended resources based on their specific project requirements. The library can also help them explore the full range of resources available to them and learn about different types of media, creation workflows, and where to look to learn more about media production processes.
